Peer review : The desktop Version looks great It looks similar to the prototype. Some suggestions I have is to make the orange hover effect for the text.  Also your alt tags have text for the 01, 02, 03 imgs.The tablet looks great for the top half but for the bottom the there is some extra space on the right. Mobile also looks very great but your button needs more spacing for the bottom and for the new div. Also there is some wierd side scroll for screen. I like how the side bar has a little animation. Other than that everything should be well good job Jeriah!
